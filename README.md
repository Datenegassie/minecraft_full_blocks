# minecraft_full_blocks
Script that automatically gets most full blocks in Minecraft and puts them in a block tag. Requires an installation of Minecraft.

This script has been tested with the latest stable version (1.16.5) and the latest snapshot (21w15a) of Minecraft.

Note: double slabs are excluded, because they are blockstates of slabs (which aren't full blocks) rather than their own block.
Barriers are also excluded because they don't have a block model.

Feel free to use this for whatever you want.
